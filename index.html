    <h2>Why Am I Taking A Coding Class?</h2>
<div></div>
        <p class="My-Content">I have been wanting to take a coding class for a while now as I think it is both interesting and valuable. I earned a Bachelors Degree in buisness management with a minor in marketing and while it was helpful, it wasn't exactly an end game career builder for me. I want a better job, I want to do something that is interesting to me. I think that coding is a creative outlet that resonates well with me. I work with websites everyday, and while I understand a lot about marketing, I want to couple that knowledge with a hard skill like website development</p>
